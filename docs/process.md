# CSS Key Panel :art:

For CSS To The Rescue I chose the modular control panel assignment. Throughout this documentation, I will be sharing the steps I followed, the challenges I encountered while attempting to create custom form elements using nothing but HTML and vanilla CSS.

The reason I chose the modular control panel assignment is because of its complexity and the creative freedom it allows. It requires creating various custom form elements such as buttons, checkboxes, radio buttons, which can be rather difficult to design and implement in HTML and CSS. However with new CSS selectors such as :has() and :not() (which I have not used before!), I should manage :D. At my current job I work with registration forms on a daily, so I think in the end this assignment will benefit me greatly. 

Additionally, I decided to go for a skeuomorphic look for my control panel design, which means I will attempt to create visual elements that mimic real-world objects.
The reason I chose skeuomorphism is primarily because it allows me to shift my focus on gradients and box-shadows, which I do not typically use in my usual 2D minimalistic style. Creating a realistic look through the use of gradients and box-shadows can be challenging, but I saw this as an opportunity to expand my skill set and challenge myself creatively!

I hope that my process documentation will provide valuable insights into my design choices and the techniques I used to create the modular control panel. Enjoy!
